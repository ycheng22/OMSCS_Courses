## [CS 7643: Deep Learning](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CS%207643%20Deep%20Learning)

  **About:** Students will learn the fundamental principles, underlying mathematics, and implementation details of deep learning. Applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing, and decision-making (reinforcement learning) will be demonstrated. PyTorch will be used.
## [CSE 6242: Data and Visual Analytics](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CSE%206242%20Data%20and%20Visual%20Analytics)

  **About:** This course will introduce you to broad classes of techniques and tools for analyzing and visualizing data at scale. Such as SQLite, Tableau, D3js, Spark/PySpark on cloud platform, Page Rank algorithm, Classification, Clustering, Scikit-Learn.

## [CS 6300: Software Development Process](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CS%206300%20Software%20Development%20Process)
  **About:** This course provides an in-depth study of the process of developing software systems, including: the use of software processes in actual product development; techniques used to ensure quality of the software products; and maintenance tasks performed as software evolves.

## [CS 6200: Introduction to Operating Systems](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CS%206200%20Intro%20to%20OS)
  **About:** Introduction to Operating Systems is a graduate-level introductory course in operating systems. This course teaches basic operating system abstractions, mechanisms, and their implementations. The core of the course focuses on OS support for concurrency (threads) and synchronization, resource management (CPU, memory, I/O), and distributed services. The practical component of the course teaches multithread programming, inter-process communication, and distributed interactions via RPC.
## [CS 6250: Computer Networks](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CS%206250%20Computer%20Networks)
  **About:** The course begins with an overview of the evolution of the Internet architecture and a short refresh of the transport layer algorithms and protocols such as TCP and congestion control. Next, the course will dive into intradomain/interdomain routing, peering and networks relationships with a follow-up into router design and functionalities. After discussing routing and router technologies, the course will continue with Software Defined Networking technologies and discuss topics that intersect Network Security and Computer Networks, for example, attacks on Internet routing such as BGP hijacking. Finally, the course wraps up with a discussion on multimedia applications and Content Delivery Networks.
## [CS 7642: Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CS%207642%20Reinforcement%20Learning)
  **About:** Topics include Markov decision processes, stochastic and repeated games, partially observable Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Of particular interest will be issues of generalization, exploration, and representation. We will cover these topics through lecture videos, paper readings, and the book Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto.
## [CSE 6220: High Performance Computing](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CSE%206220%20High%20Performance%20Computing)
  **About:** This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. The techniques youâ€™ll encounter cover the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and manycore shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). 

## [CS 6035: Intro to Information Security](https://github.com/ycheng22/OMSCS_Courses/tree/main/CS%206035%20Intro%20to%20Information%20Security)
  **About:** Main topics include: security basics; security management and risk assessment; software security; operating systems security; database security; cryptography algorithms and protocols; network authentication and secure network applications; malicious malware; network threats and defenses; web security; mobile security; legal and ethical issues; and privacy.
